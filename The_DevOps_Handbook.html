					  <li>Part 1: Introduction&nbsp;
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>Devops was a convergence of a lot of manufacturing thought advancement</li>
					      <li>Two lean tenets: best predictor of quality, customer satisfaction, and employee &nbsp;happiness is manufacturing lead time and best predictor of lead time is small batch sizes</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Chapter 1: Agile, CD and the Three Ways
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>Focused on deployment lead time - getting something to production. Not processing time as much because it omits queue time</li>
					      <li>%C/A - % complete and accurate. Can customers use it as is?</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Chapter 2: The First Way - The Principles of Flow
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>Make work visible. Kanban or sprint board. Makes it easy to move work left to right and see how long it takes.&nbsp;</li>
					      <li>Limit work in process. Constrain queues and limit what’s accepted into the system. You can focus your engineers and reduce their context switching as well as see choke points which you can then fix. Also reduces variability in the system overall and with each downstream team.&nbsp;</li>
					      <li>Small batches. Shrink batch sizes. You get product out the door much faster which means you earn money and get feedback immediately. Also, you can find errors much faster. Envelope folding example where you perform each step for all brochures vs performing each step on one brochure at a time. Also reduces size of change to production meaning lower operational overhead.&nbsp;</li>
					      <li>Continually identify and elevate the constraint. “Any improvement not made at the constraint is an illusion” Dr. Goldratt.&nbsp;</li>
					      <li>Eliminate waste. Anything that delays value for the customer. Seven lean software dev wastes: partially done work, extra processes, extra features, task switching, waiting, motion, defects, nonstandard or manual work, heroics.&nbsp;</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Chapter 3: The Second Way - The Principles of Feedback.&nbsp;
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>&nbsp;Working safely in complex systems. Failure is inevitable so design systems to catch it. Four ways to make complex system safer: manage work to reveal problems, swarm problems, propagate new knowledge globally, create leaders to grow these capabilities.&nbsp;</li>
					      <li>Keep pushing quality closer to the source. Approvals and inspections don’t help because they’re often too removed from the thing they’re approving. Also, they slow the process and therefore delay the feedback cycle.&nbsp;</li>
					      <li>Optimize for downstream work centers. Most important customer is the next link in the manufacturing chain.&nbsp;</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Chapter 4: The Third Way - The Principles of Continuous Learning and Experimentation&nbsp;
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>Create a blameless culture or else people will hide problems.&nbsp;</li>
					      <li>Make specific time to improve process and pay down tech debt.&nbsp;</li>
					      <li>Make learnings global. Documentation, make RCAs searchable, etc.&nbsp;</li>
					      <li>Inject constraint and failure to test your system and improve it. Having overhead people doesn’t allow you to see issues.</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					</ul>
					<p>Part 2: Where to Start - Introduction.</p>
					<ul type="disc">
					  <li>&nbsp;Chapter 5 - Electing the Right Value Stream to Start With
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>Consider greenfield vs brownfield, systems of record vs systems of engagement</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Chapter 6 - Understanding the Work in Our Value Stream, Making it Visible, and Expanding it Across the Organization&nbsp;
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>Do a value stream map on a board and identify the times, pick a step to improve and then do it. And make sure you measure before and after.&nbsp;</li>
					      <li>Create a dedicated transformation team and hold them accountable to a system wide metric like improving deployment time.&nbsp;</li>
					      <li>Keep improvement planning horizons short</li>
					      <li>Marty Cagan saves eBay in the 90s , estimates teams need at least 20% of time to handle tech debt regularly, boom: Inspired: how to create products customers love.&nbsp;</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Chapter 7 - How to Design Organization and Architecture with Conway's Law in Mind
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>Your system reflects your org structure.&nbsp;</li>
					      <li>Three org archetypes: functional, matrix and market.&nbsp;</li>
					      <li>Should shift toward market teams to enable speed and agility.&nbsp;</li>
					      <li>We typically focus metrics on project development but neglect the expensive and long tail of maintenance of the customer</li>
					      <li>Keep teams small. Two pizza team rule! Teams should be 5-10 people.&nbsp;</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Chapter 8 - How to Get Great Outcomes by Integrating Operations into the Daily Work of Development&nbsp;
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>Embed ops where possible in the business and with devs. Use liaisons at least when embedding isn’t possible.&nbsp;</li>
					      <li>Build tools to make life easier for devs but don’t force them on it. Make it work better than alternatives. Ensure they are self service so ops is not a bottleneck.&nbsp;</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Part III - The First way. The Technical Practices of Flow</li>
					  <li>Chapter 9: Create the Foundations of our Deployment Pipeline
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>Enable on demand dev test and prod environments&nbsp;</li>
					      <li>Create a repository system and process</li>
					      <li>Make infra easier to rebuild than repair</li>
					      <li>Done is when code is in production</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Chapter 10: Enable Fast and Reliable Automated Testing
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>Code should flow at least through build and test automatically</li>
					      <li>“Without automated tests, as we add more code our cost increases almost linearly”</li>
					      <li>Testing types
					        <ul type="disc">
					          <li>Unit tests - Typically test single method, class or function</li>
					          <li>Acceptance tests - Tests whole application to ensure higher level functions are operating as intended</li>
					          <li>Integration tests - Test that our app works with the whole suite of related apps</li>
					        </ul>
					      </li>
					      <li>Test coverage - Typically as a function of classes, lines of code, permutations, etc.</li>
					      <li>Test Driven Development - Write the test for outcome first and THEN write the code</li>
					      <li>If you have a test that fails, consider adding another test earlier in the process</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Chapter 11: Enable and Practice Continuous Integration
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>CI/trunk based development - smaller commits, more frequently</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Chapter 12: Automate and Enable Low-Risk Releases
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>Requirements for deployment pipeline
					        <ul type="disc">
					          <li>Deploying the same way in every env</li>
					          <li>Smoke testing deployments</li>
					          <li>Maintain consistent environments</li>
					        </ul>
					      </li>
					      <li>Enable developers to do most if not all of a release themselves -&gt; ownership</li>
					      <li>Decouple feature release (to customers) from code deployment (simply distributing to production)</li>
					      <li>Two ways of doing release
					        <ul type="disc">
					          <li>Environment based - put new feature on a few servers of the whole fleet and slowly move some production traffic</li>
					          <li>Application-based release - Have logic in the app to release features to a specific set of customers</li>
					        </ul>
					      </li>
					      <li>Release patterns
					        <ul type="disc">
					          <li>Blue/green - Create two environments (blue and green). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Take the green environment and add new code/release. &nbsp;Move traffic from blue to green and roll back if needed.</li>
					          <li>Canary - Release new code to small portion of fleet and, if it causes issues, halt release.</li>
					          <li>Cluster Immune System - link production monitoring to release process and if metrics dip outside historical during release ,halt the release</li>
					          <li>Feature Flag</li>
					          <li>Dark launch - Launch the feature into prod and have it running but don't have user see the results. &nbsp;For example, a new search algorithm that runs both the old and new algorithm when a user queries but only shows the user the old one. &nbsp;Over time, add more users until comfortable with performance risk.</li>
					        </ul>
					      </li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Chapter 13: Architect for Low Risk Releases
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>Architecture makes sense when it's made. &nbsp;Just get used to migrating as it ages</li>
					      <li>Strangler Application Pattern: Instead of fixing old apps that aren't worth it, put them behind an API and move on</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Part IV: The Second Way - The Technical Practices of Feedback</li>
					  <li>Chapter 14: Create Telemetry to Enable Seeing and Solving Problems
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>First, it's important</li>
					      <li>Centralize logs and ensure you have business logic, app and infra data in your monitoring</li>
					      <li>Telemetry access and implementation should be simple for everyone</li>
					      <li>Create information radiators -&gt; TVs, dashboards, etc.</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Chapter 15: Analyze Telemetry to Better Anticipate Problems and Achieve Goals
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>Alerting off of standard deviations is great since it has statistical foundations</li>
					      <li>Unfortunately, most operational workloads are not normally distributed so we'd under or over alert</li>
					      <li>Your telemetry should alert on the thing you ultimately care about: adverse customer outcomes
					        <ul type="disc">
					          <li>If your data is mostly smooth with a few small spikes, you don't want an alert that goes off every two hours especially if that brief spike is no concern</li>
					        </ul>
					      </li>
					      <li>Consider smoothing metrics like a 30 day moving average for example</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Chapter 16: Enable Feedback So Development and Operations Can Safely Deploy Code
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>Developers should be in the on call rotation</li>
					      <li>It may make sense to do a "service handback" sometimes, that is, to hand back to the developers to run a particularly broken service. &nbsp;If the service isn't stable, devas should run it until they can make it stable</li>
					      <li>Launch Readiness Review and Handoff Readiness Review (LRR and HRR)
					        <ul type="disc">
					          <li>LRR for public consumption and HRR for ops handoff</li>
					        </ul>
					      </li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Chapter 17: Integrate Hypothesis Driven Development and A/B Testing into Our Daily Work
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>Ronny Kohavi of MSFT: "Only 1/3 of features tested were determined to have material impact on buying outcomes" -&gt; 2/3 of features did NOT end up increasing sales despite expert opinions they would do so</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Chapter 18: Create Review and Coordination Processes to Increase Quality of Our Current Work
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>Don't over control your changes -&gt; you can't make it bullet proof and you'll likely only increase failures wit more control built in</li>
					      <li>Enable coordination of change schedules (change calendar for high risk like networking)</li>
					      <li>Enable peer review of changes and keep changes small
					        <ul type="disc">
					          <li>"Ask a dev &nbsp;to review ten lines of code, he'll find ten problems. &nbsp;Ask him to review 500 lines and he'll say it looks good"</li>
					        </ul>
					      </li>
					      <li>Pair programming either by sharing the code work evenly and therefore sharing workarounds/best practices or by providing immediate feedback and splitting the testing and code writing portions between programmers
					        <ul type="disc">
					          <li>15% slower but 70-85% fewer errors</li>
					        </ul>
					      </li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Part V: The Third Way - The Technical Practices of Continual Learning and Experimentation</li>
					  <li>Chapter 19: Enable and inject Learning into Daily Work
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>Blameless culture -&gt; don't hide your problems</li>
					      <li>Publish your post-mortems publicly</li>
					      <li>Once you manage the big failures, start to amplify the small failures to get further down and sniff out potential future catastrophes</li>
					      <li>Redefine failure and encourage smart risk-taking</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Chapter 20: Convert Local Discoveries into Global Improvements
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>Google has just one repository for EVERYTHING -&gt; everyone sees everything and shares the learning
					        <ul type="disc">
					          <li>Config standards, libraries, deployment tools, pipeline tools, tutorials, etc.</li>
					        </ul>
					      </li>
					      <li>Codify nonfunctional requirements. &nbsp;Having devs involved in running things means stuff like proper telemetry, forward/backward compatibility, data cleanup processes and more tend to get built faster</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Chapter 21: Reserve Time to Create Organizational Learning and Improvement
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>Institutionalize processes to pay down technical debt</li>
					      <li>Enable everyone to teach and learn</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Part VI: The Technological Practices of Integration Information Security, Change Management, and Compliance&nbsp;</li>
					  <li>Chapter 22: Information Security as Everyone's Job, Every Day
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>Integrate security in post mortems, repositories, deployment pipelines, etc.</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					  <li>Chapter 23: Protecting the Deployment Pipeline
					    <ul type="circle">
					      <li>Reduce reliance on separation of duty - everyone owns their own work</li>
					    </ul>
					  </li>
					</ul>
