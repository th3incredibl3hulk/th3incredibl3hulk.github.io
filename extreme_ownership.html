						<li>Foreword</li>
							<ul>
								<li>		A lot of mostly innocuous discussion about broad armed services stuff, security review with Pentagon before publishing, etc.</li>
								<li>Heartfelt tribute to the brothers and sisters in arms but not necessary for the average reader</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Introduction</li>
							<ul >
								<li>The Laws of Combat:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Cover and Move</li>
										<li>Simple</li>
										<li>Prioritize and Execute</li>
										<li>Decentralized Command</li>
									</ul>
							</ul>
						<li>Each chapter follows a format:</li>
							<ul>
								<li>			 First, a leadership lesson</li>
								<li>			 Second, explains the principle,</li>
								<li>			Third, explains application to business world</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Part I - Winning the War Within</li>
						<li>Chapter 1 - Extreme Ownership</li>
							<ul>
								<li>		 Story about the fog of war in which Willink barely stopped a friendly fire incident. Seals and Iraqi soldiers mistook each other for enemies and opened heavy fire. Lesson is that ultimately the leader owned the near failure. No one else. Willink took full responsibility </li>
								<li>		 Principle: The leader owns everything even bad performers. If you have them lead them out. Always own failures, never own successes. Let your team own those and they will naturally adopt a team first culture. </li>
								<li>		Application: story of a VP that was leading a failing initiative to fix the company. He blamed everything but himself in e process until Willink helped him see the light and eventually own his failure as a leader because regardless of what his subordinates failed to do his project was failing and no one else’s.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>	Chapter 2: no bad teams, only bad leaders</li>
							<ul>
								<li>		Story: Seal team Buds week aka hell week training. One team was constantly winning while another was constantly failing. Leader of failing platoon thought he just had a bad team so swapped leaders and the low performing team suddenly began performing. Meanwhile good team kept performing well but only because they were already functioning</li>
								<li>		Principle: “it’s not what you preach, it’s what you tolerate. “ if you simply allow substandard performance that becomes the new standard</li>
								<li>		Application: workshop where babin presented to leadership of failing company. CTO rejected extreme ownership because he didn’t want to acknowledge his failures. Was a “tortured genius” ie someone who’s so smart but the world can’t see it and so they are tortured. Eventually was fired and replaced but only after ceo tried to flip his mentality and failed. </li>
							</ul>
						<li>	Chapter 3: Believe</li>
							<ul>
								<li>		Story: asked to take Iraqi regulars with them on combat ops. Huge cultural issue. Seals Rely on brothers they know and Iraqi soldiers sucked and had terrible or no equipment at all. Eventually Willink came to accept the mission realizing that training Iraqis up meant they could run their own country and not need us military personnel forever. Also found they had tremendous local knowledge that Americans could never have like how to pick local locks or discern enemies from friends. </li>
								<li>		Principle: the leader must understand and believe the why of their mission and how it impacts broadly. If they don’t they must ask superiors until they do. If they can’t get to belief they won’t get their people there either and the mission will fail. </li>
								<li>		Application: new sales company plan that hurt comp   Managers worried good people would leave but too afraid to ask the boss why she was doing this. Boss explained the why of decision: pushing out low performers by hurting them more and that would shrink sales and increase volume per person meaning they could net earn more money.   </li>
							</ul>
						<li>	Chapter 4: check the ego</li>
							<ul>
								<li>		 Story: new unit on base was cocky and refused to share key details of operations and locations. Also rejected cultural norms of the base. Never integrated with base team and could have gotten people killed in combat. As a result had to leave combat area and miss out on the action. </li>
								<li>		Principle:no ego</li>
								<li>		 Application:  IC that replaced a part without approval and set the project back significantly. Leader pissed. Had to check ego and approach it as his failure to institute the process. </li>
							</ul>
						<li>	Chapter 5: cover and move </li>
							<ul>
								<li>		 Seal sniper team covers operation but from exposed spot. Decides to leave after op is done outside SOP of moving at night because enemy attack very likely. While leaving they cover and move for each other as a squad even when engaged by the enemy. Once back at base, yelled at because they didn’t coordinate with other seal team that could have covered them and then they could have covered. Stupid risk. </li>
								<li>		Principle: if anyone fails the team fails. </li>
								<li>		Application: production manager having issues with subsidiary of patent company not delivering on time. Willinks advised them to reach out and form a bond, same mission</li>
							</ul>
						<li>	 Chapter 6: Simple</li>
							<ul>
								<li>		 Story: new leader helping train Iraqi units wanted to take complex patrol through streets of Ramadi. Willink talked him back to a simpler mission which was good because they were quickly engaged and needed evac which. Would have been impossible if further away or on more treacherous route. Also all communication was very concise and that enabled speed and thus advantage. </li>
								<li>		 Principle: simple</li>
								<li>		 Application: bonus plan that was too complex with many factors. Production personnel ignored it because they couldn’t understand it. Team simplified and immediately increased productivity while removing four low performers because of new efficiency</li>
							</ul>
						<li>	 Chapter 7: prioritize and execute</li>
							<ul>
								<li>		 Story: very dangerous mission. While leaving, discover ied so plant charge to blow it and use alternate route. During evac, soldier falls twenty feet through roof. Babin keeps his head and prioritizes the tasks. Set security, get off roof, get wounded seal, get away from blast. Because he set direction quickly team stayed coordinated</li>
								<li>		 Principle: always stay a step or two ahead of real time. Plan contingencies and always brief your team any time there’s a change in objectives or situation on the ground. Evaluate the highest priority, devote resources to it and then move to the next </li>
								<li>		 Application: ceo trying to save failing company but had so many initiatives it was unclear what was most important. Simplified and prioritized. </li>
							</ul>
						<li>	 Chapter 8: decentralized command</li>
							<ul>
								<li>		 Story: Soldiers given freedom to make battlefield decisions accounting for leaders overall intent. Can switch positions or engagement method if it sticks to overall tasking. Leaders are to say what they will do and why to their superiors instead of asking how they should do it. </li>
								<li>		 Principle: junior leaders expected to know their limits and ask for recommendations only when outside their authority. Otherwise they execute to the commanders intent as they see fit. To do this, senior leaders must be clear on the why and junior leaders must clarify if needed. Also senior leaders must back their junior leaders to truly extend that trust. Senior leaders must constantly communicate situational awareness to junior leaders and junior leaders back up.  Balancing involvement and strategic positioning is key. </li>
								<li>		 Application: bank leader that had branches of wildly different sizes that prevented leaders from effectively managing 4-6 people either they were spread too thin or didn’t have enough people so had to pick up slack </li>
							</ul>
						<li>	 Chapter 9: Plan</li>
							<ul>
								<li>		 Story: had to rescue hostage but right before assault got new info about possible ieds and machine gun nests. Proceeded anyway because plan called for Stealth already assuming those would be risks anyway. Good plan already, stick with it </li>
								<li>		Principle: should have some kind of standardized planning process in any team. Analyze the real mission, evaluate resources at your disposal and decentralize decision making to the leaders closest to their part of the op. Always measure your success and debrief post op so you can improve all the time. </li>
								<li>		Application: when in training had to develop clear planning process to get deployed to Iraq which was huge honor. Had to focus on lowest common denominator and make sure commanders intent was clear </li>
							</ul>
						<li>	 Chapter 10: leading up and down the chain of command</li>
							<ul>
								<li>		 Story: basically just Babin realizing they did a lot and he failed to adequately explain to his Troops the strategic context for Their work. Likewise Willink failed to explain to Babin I’m sufficient detail. In the heat of it, Ics don’t have context for the strategy without recurring and plentiful updates. Separately senior leaders were asking tons of questions for every op adding lots of work to op planning. Babin finally realized it was because they weren’t pushing situational awareness up the ladder adequately. He started submitting better requests with more detail and invited leadership out to the battle to see and understand the nuance better. </li>
								<li>		 Principle:   Same. </li>
								<li>		 Application: same.  </li>
							</ul>
						<li>	 Chapter 11: decisiveness amid uncertainty </li>
							<ul>
								<li>		 Story: nearly killed a friendly by misidentifying the building. Partner leader giving pressure to shoot the sniper in the window but they held off because they weren’t sure it was an enemy. Ended up it was friendly and thankfully he hadn’t caved</li>
								<li>		 Principle: act decisively even with uncertainty </li>
								<li>		 Application : two senior engineers that were constantly bickering and fighting. Eventually got to a point where each insisted the other be fired. Ceo fires them both because they couldn’t work it out </li>
							</ul>
						<li>	 Chapter 12: discipline equals freedom - the dichotomy of leadership</li>
							<ul>
								<li>		 Story: changed the way they searched building which had been chaotic and slow. Organized the search process so that each seal had a job and was responsible for one room and searched it methodically. Sped up the process and made it much easier to use in court. </li>
								<li>		 Principle: the Dichrotomy of Leadership - a good leader must be:</li>
									<ul>
										<li>			 Confident but not cocky</li>
										<li>			 Courageous but not foolhardy</li>
										<li>		 Competitive but a gracious loser</li>
										<li>			 Detail oriented but not obsessed</li>
										<li>			 Strong but have endurance </li>
										<li>			 A leader and follower</li>
										<li>			 Humble but not passive</li>
										<li>			 Aggressive not overbearing</li>
										<li>			 Quiet not silent </li>
										<li>			Calm but not robotic</li>
										<li>			 Close to team but not so close they forget he’s leader</li>
										<li>			A good leader had nothing to prove but everything to prove </li>
									</ul>
								<li>		 Application: ceo had to close division of company run by close friend because it was failing but he didn’t want to. Finally made the tough call and the leader actually respected him for it. </li>
							</ul>
						<li>	 Afterword: Not much I got from this worth sharing.</li>
